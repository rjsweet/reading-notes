# The command line and you!

The basic idea of the command line, or *terminal* is to manipulate code in a text based format.

## Things to remember!

* Each terminal will have a **shell** which is part of how it interacts with the computers operation system. 
* **Commands** are used to interact with and navigate through the system files via the terminal.
* Two forms of that navigation are in **absolute** and **relative** paths

Absolute paths
: begin with a forward slash / and specify a file location in relation to the root directory, or the very top of the file structure.

Relative paths
: Don't have a forward slash and reference their location in relation to your present location within the system.
