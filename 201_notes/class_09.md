## Warm Up

/**
 * Using two for loops nested together, write some javascript that will print into the console this pattern:
 
     *
     ** 
     ***
     ****
     *****
 
 * Use any data structures or functions that you'd like
**/

```

## Wireframe Review

## HTML Events

- When we do things in the browser
  - hovering over element
  - pressing a key on the keyboard
  - clicking
    - mouse down + mouseup.
    - the brower is aware that this happens.
    - as developers we have the power to call functions, toggle classes, run any js when these occur
- Forms are the most prevelent element to get interactions from the user and we need to learn how to handle all the events that occur around form inputs. 

## notes to self

- look up git upstream options
