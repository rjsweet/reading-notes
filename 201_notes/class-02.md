## Warmup
create a set of bash terminal commands that will create the following folders and files

.
|
| - folder1
|     | - folder_1_file1.html
|     | - folder_1_file2.html
| - folder2
|     | - folder_2_file1.html
|     | - folder_3
|     |     | - folder_3_file1.html
| - file_0.md

```
'mkdir folder1' -> creates a folder in our current terminal directory called "folder1"

'cd folder1' -> moves into folder1

`touch folder_1_file1.html` -> create the file in the directory we just moved into.

`mkdir folder1 &&  cd

`touch folder1/folder_1_file1.html` assumes folder already exists, allows creation of file inside of designated folder. creates the file at the specific path

`rm -rf folder_name` -> removes a folder from our current terminal/ folder/directory

Let's say our terminal is in folder 3 `touch ../../folder_1_file3.html`
