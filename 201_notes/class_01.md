# Notes for Class 01

## Ducket HTML
        1. HTML Chapter 1: "Structure"
                - HTML pages are text documents. 
                - HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
                - Tages are often referred to as elements.
                - Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
                - Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element. 
                - Attributes require a name and a value.
                - To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

## Lab01 Demo Notes

" <!DOCTYPE html>" tells the browser reading the file that the following text is html. Browser doesn't necessarily see the file, but rather the text in the file?

- What is the bare minimum frame of a web page? 

html
<!Doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<title>
</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```
